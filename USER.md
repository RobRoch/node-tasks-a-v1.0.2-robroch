Tasks evaluation
-
* Difficulty level: First 9 tasks were quite easy. Got big problems with PUT method as json file and adding new, updating in memory, without using built methods like in mongoose f.e.
* Time: About 8 hours.
* Comments: I have problems to understand fully about node memory usage. Learned few things while doing them.

Frameworks and modules
-
Please list the frameworks and modules used in your program
and explain briefly why did you choose them.

### Web framework
Express - helping a lot to write simpler code in node. For example I don't need to worry about request, response headers.

### Test framework
None - no time left to do last task.

### Other modules
body-parser - while doing tasks found body-parser helping with different file formats.
nodemon - helpful while implementing code.
